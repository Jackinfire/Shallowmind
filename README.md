## Request for the Assessor

- The app is simulating 1hr of data and updating every minute
- As per user requirements, amber alert only switches on after 5min and red after 20min of consecutive posture
- Hence to see the full App workings, one would need to wait a minimal of 20min (or change thread.sleep in LiveMonitor.java)
- THANK YOU!!
